# Image-to-Sentiment-Project


The problems was to classify quotes or text in images which are distributed across the web in the categories as Positive , Negative, Random or inconclusive.

To read text on images i used Google Tesseract OCR-
Tesseract 4 adds a new neural net (LSTM) based OCR engine which is focused on line recognition, but also still supports the legacy Tesseract OCR engine of Tesseract 3 which works by recognizing character patterns.
